\lhead{Chapter 4. \emph{Evaluation Plan}}

The primary goal for this project is to develop a tool that can be used by lab
coordinators and students. The main feature of this tool will be to give a
graphical representation of the similarity of students' code. A key method in
testing the usefulness of this measure will be an analysis into the correlation
of marks with a high similarity measure. If the data shows a high similarity
between to pieces of work whilst the grades vary significantly, this would indicate
an error within the algorithm. 

This goal adds a large element of risk to the project -- research into code
similarity detection methods is still ongoing, with many conflicting ideas. As
such, it is very possible that this goal is unreachable as part of this project;
for example if it is found that there is too much variation in the similarity
measure and no real clusters can be formed (even when code appears similar through
manual inspection), then there would be little use to this tool. This however is
still an interesting result, as we will spend a lot of time analysing how well
the algorithms presented perform, and uncover reasons why they fail for our
purposes.
